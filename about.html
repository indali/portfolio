<h1>About Me</h1>
<div>
<p>My name is Indali and I am a rising junior at Lynbrook High School in San Jose, California. Some of my hobbies including reading, writing, coding
    and cooking! My likes include the color blue and baking cookies, and some dislikes I have include not reaching the goals I set for myself each day.
    A fun fact about me is that I love to read quotes! Some of my favorite sites include <a href "amazon.com">Amazon</a> </p>
